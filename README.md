## 📋 Overview
DHARMA is an interactive web security awareness platform designed to educate developers, security enthusiasts, and students about common web vulnerabilities and protection measures. Through hands-on examples, interactive animations, and simulated attacks, users can safely learn about security threats and prevention techniques.

## ✨ Features
- **Interactive Demonstrations**: Visual animations showing how different attacks work
- **Hands-on Learning**: Safe environments to test and understand vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Simulations**: Practice identifying and exploiting common web security issues
- **Educational Content**: In-depth explanations and prevention techniques
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with all devices
- **Security Games**: Learn through gamified experiences
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Get assistance and learn through conversation

## 🌐 Demo
Access the live demo: [https://dharma-security.com](https://dharma-security.com)

## 💻 Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Font Awesome for icons
- Spline for 3D animations
- Responsive design techniques
- Authentication system

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dharma-security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dharma-security
   ```

3. Open the project in a web server or use the live server extension in VS Code.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Navigate through the topics using the menu
3. Interact with the demonstrations and try the examples
4. Complete the learning paths for each vulnerability

## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities Covered
The platform currently covers three major web security vulnerabilities:

### SQL Injection
- Demonstrations of how SQL injection attacks work
- Interactive playground to test different injection techniques
- Prevention methods and secure coding practices

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Three types of XSS attacks (Reflected, Stored, DOM-based)
- Visual animations showing attack vectors
- Testing environment for XSS payloads
- Mitigation strategies

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- How CSRF attacks compromise user sessions
- Preventative measures including CSRF tokens
- Real-world examples

## 🎮 Interactive Learning
DHARMA offers various interactive learning methods:

1. **Animated Visualizations**: See how attacks flow between browser, server, and database
2. **Code Examples**: Both vulnerable and secure code samples
3. **Hands-on Playground**: Test attacks in a controlled environment
4. **Step-by-step Tutorials**: Guided learning paths
5. **Gaming Section**: Security-focused games for reinforcement learning
